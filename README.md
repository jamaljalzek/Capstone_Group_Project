# Capstone_Group_Project
Our vision was a privacy respecting and secure messaging mobile application.

We designed and developed an architecture that guarantees privacy for the end users, to the point that even we, the developers, are unable to access the encrypted messages that are stored in the cloud. No snooping eyes allowed!

This is a cross platform (Android and iOS) mobile application built with:
  1. C# for our backend logic
  2. XAML for our frontend GUI
  3. .NET for its libraries relating to cryptography, web requests, etc.
  4. Xamarin Forms for providing us a cross platform foundation
  5. NewtonSoft Json.NET for easy conversion to and from the JSON format

For our cloud database, we used:
  1. AWS as our host
  2. Elastic Beanstalk for our base server
  3. PHP for our server logic
  4. SQL for setting up our relational database
